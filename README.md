`manyfmt`
=========

This Rust library, `manyfmt`, provides adapters with which you can easily create more varieties of
formatting than the std::fmt traits (`Display`, `Debug`, `Binary`, `LowerHex`, `Pointer`) offer,
without having to write any more boilerplate than absolutely necessary. You can also easily pass
additional data down through the formatting recursion.

This library is `no_std` compatible; it can run anywhere Rust can.
